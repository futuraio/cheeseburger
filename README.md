# cheeseburger

Cheeseburger is a work-in-progress methodology that Futura IO deploys for Product Development.

Influenced by

  - [d.school DT](http://dschool.stanford.edu/)
  - failing at finishing many products

The name is derived from the idea that a product development process should introduce product variance.

### Prelude
This is not a joke.

### Structure
Cheeseburger is facilitated by moving product features through a flagging system. Every product feature is treated on an equal playing field and therefore organized by the same global system for product development. Features can have 4 stages; `proposed`, `testing`, `active` and `used`. At any point in development any feature can move forward or backward on this track.
