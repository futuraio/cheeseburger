# cheeseburger

Cheeseburger is a work-in-progress methodology that Futura IO deploys for Product Development.

Influenced by

  - [d.school DT](http://dschool.stanford.edu/)
  - failing at finishing many products

The name is derived from the idea that a product development process should introduce product variance.
